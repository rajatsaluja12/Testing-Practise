Download The Jmeter from the official website Apache
you will get a zip file while downloading, unzip and then go to bin and run the exe file. no need to install anything

Terminologies 

Connection Time : Time to connect to Server from Client 
	
Response Time : is a measure of how responsive an application or subsystem is to a client request 

Throughput : Indicates the number of transaction per second an application can handle , the amount of transaction produced over during a test,
request per second , calls per day, hits per second, reports per year etc

Scenarios : In the context of performance testing, a scenario is a sequence of steps in your application, 
A scenario can represent a use case or a business function such as searching a product catalog, adding an item to a shopping cart or placing an order
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Performance Testing is a practice conducted to determine how a system performs in term of responsiveness and stabilty under a particular workload. 
It can also serve to investigate, measure, validate or verify other quality attributes of the system , such as scalability , reliability usage.

Bottleneck : Used to describe a single part of a system that prevents further processing or significantly degrades the performance of the system as a whole

Capacity : The degree to which a system can perform data processing until performance degrades. For example, the number of new customer being added to a database 

Concurrency : Normally this means the number of simultaneous virtual users driving transaction across the user journey in a given performance test scenario, but can also mean the number of 
transaction synchronised to happen at exactly the same point

Key Performance Indicator(KPI) : The set of targets which set the expected performance targets within the production system. These may include page response time(eg 99% of pages loaded <=2 seconds),
user concurrency batch processing times, data throughput volumes , transaction failure rates , and underlying infrastructure behaviour(eg. Maximum Average CPU used, Minimum Free memory Available,
threshold for remaining physical storage/ disk usage)

Load Testing : A Type of performance testing used to evaluate the behavior of a system or component when the load on the system(via users and transaction) progressively increases up to and
including peak levels

Non functional requirement(NFRs) : Requirements that do not relate to the functioning of the system, but to other aspects of the system such as reliability, usability and performance

Performance Engineering : Activities designed to ensure a system will be designed and implemented to meet specific non functional requirement. Often takes place following completion of testing 
activites that highlight weakness in the design and implementation

Performance Test plan : Typically a written document that details the objectives, scope, approach, deliverables, schedule, risk, data and test environment needs for testing on a specific project

Performance Testing: Testing designed to determine the performance level of a system

Reliability : Related to stability , reliability is the degree to which a system provides the same result for the same action over time under load

Scalability : The degree to which a system's performance and capacity can be increased typically by increasing available hardware resource within a set of servers(vertical scaling)
or increasing the number of servers available to service request(horizontal scaling )

Soak Testing : A type of Performance testing used to evaluate the behaviour of a system or component when the system is subjected to expected load over a sustained period of time 

Spike Testing : A type of performance testing used to evaluate the behaviour of a system or component when subjected to large short term changes in demand. Normally this is to test how the system 
responds to large increase in demand e.g., User login, Black Friday-like sales events etc. 

Stability : The degree to which a system exhibits failures and error when under normal usage. For example erroneous error when registering new users under load

Stress Testing : A type of performance testing used to evaluate the behaviour of a system or component when subjected to load beyond the anticipated workload or by reducing the resources the system 
can use, such as CPU or memory

Transaction Volume Model(TVM): A document detailing the user journey to be simulated, the click-path steps that makes up the user journeys and associated load/transaction volume model to be tested. 
This should include information regarding the geographical locate from where user will be expected to interact with the system and the method of interaction eg. mobile vs desktop

User journey - The path through the system under text that group of Virtual User will use to simulate real user . It should be noted that key performance/volume impacting journeys should be used
as it is impractical to performance test all possible user journey , a good rule-of-thumb is to use the 20% of user journeys that generate 80% of the volume 

Virtual User : A simulated user that performs action as a real user would during the execution of a test
